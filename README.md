# Hangman
Hangman is a word guessing game. The computer thinks of a word and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. In most variants, proper nouns, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. If the player guesses the word correctly within the number of chances given, he/she wins the game. On the other hand, if the player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over
